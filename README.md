# Todoist Indicator plugin for Obsidian

This is an Obsidian plugin that shows whether Todoist links are available on Project files by adding custom badges to project files if the linkt to todoist is missing. It is heavily inspired by obsidian-gtd-no-next-step from saibotsivad (thanks!).

## Features

- Automatically add badges to project files based on availability of Todoist property.
- Customize project folder prefix and Todoist property through settings.
- Optionally require a specific project tag for badge application.
